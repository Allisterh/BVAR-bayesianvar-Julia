# Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregressive Model with Sign Restriction
 Toolkit julia source codes and example outputs on Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregressive Model with Sign Restriction first published by [Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) replication code](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA12356).

The execution code is a direct translation from the MATLAB codes published by [Christiane Baumeister](https://sites.google.com/site/cjsbaumeister/research).

The sample output is based on a derivation of works, that includes my identification of price spread to capture the market demand shock as a separate identification strategy.
